      <p>
      With  SAP S/4HANA  it is possible to carry out analytics directly in the transactional system  (embedded analytics) . 

We are addressing the question of which planning, reporting and analysis applications can be implemented directly in SAP S/4HANA Embedded Analytics - without having to operate a separate business warehouse (BW). And how to integrate “Embedded Analytics” and SAP BW – for the best of both worlds.

We develop practical guidelines and showcases in our demo landscape to make the topic accessible and understandable for our customers.
