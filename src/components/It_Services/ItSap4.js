      SAP Architectural Planning
      </h1>
      <p>We put different  SAP planning architectures  to the test – SAC Native, S/4 Native, BPC  Live Connection or, in the future, planning with DWC. Our extensive demo landscape is available to us.

We bring clarity to the SAP “planning jungle” and work with you to find the right architectures and processes for your individual requirements.  

In addition to reviewing the architecture of your current SAP planning landscape, we also pay attention to the processes within your organization.</p>
